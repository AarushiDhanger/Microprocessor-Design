# Microprocessor Systems Design
## Overview
This repository showcases lab assignments completed during a Microprocessor Systems Design course. The focus was on understanding and implementing key concepts such as system architecture, CPU organization, bus systems, debugging mechanisms, and I/O interface design.

## Project Description
The course involved designing circuits for a microcomputer with a microcontroller-based board (Mega 2560). Software was developed to emulate a microprocessor, and controlled functions such as address decoding, memory access, and I/O interfacing.

## Key Learnings
- **Problem Solving:** Formulating and solving engineering design problems.
- **System Understanding:** Analyzing system architecture and CPU operation.
- **Debugging:** Designing and implementing debugging mechanisms.
- **Bus Systems:** Building data, address, and control bus systems.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Conducting system performance evaluation and timing calculation.
- **Interrupt Techniques:** Understanding and implementing interrupt techniques.
- **Documentation:** Generating formal technical specifications and reports.
